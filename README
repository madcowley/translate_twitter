translate_twitter is a Sinatra app that will return the results of a twitter search, with translations.

At the moment, it defaults to using the #honduras search term, and only translates into English; it was 
originally written so I could understand the tweets on the #honduras feed, most of which are in Spanish.

Translations are based on the google translation api, with code copped from http://ruby.geraldbauer.ca/google-translation-api.html

Oh, and Sinatra is pretty cool, too: http://www.sinatrarb.com/

TODO: add a way to specify a search term, and choose your destination language.  And other stuff that would make it cooler.
